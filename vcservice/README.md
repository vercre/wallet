# Vercre Wallet Demonstration Service

This crate provides a simple integrated Verifiable Credential Issuer and Verifier service over HTTP. It can only issue and verify a couple of hard-coded credentials and is intended to be used simply to test and demonstrate the `wallet` application, the main target of this workspace.

See the workspace README for how to get started demonstrating the wallet using this service.
